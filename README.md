# Sales Conversion Funnel Analysis: Olist E-commerce Dataset

## Project Overview

This project analyses the **sales conversion funnel** of Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform, to identify where user drop-offs occur across different stages:

1. Order Created (Viewed)
2. Added to Cart
3. Payment Approved (Checkout Completed)
4. Delivered (Purchase Success)

Using **real transactional data**, the project quantifies drop-off rates, visualises funnel performance, and provides actionable business recommendations to improve conversions and revenue.

- Significant drop-offs observed between **adding items to cart and payment approval**.
- Additional drop-offs occur post-payment during the **delivery stage**, indicating logistic inefficiencies.
